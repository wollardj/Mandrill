If you're here because of MailChimp, my apologies but this isn't the Mandrill you're looking for. /wavehand\r\n\r\n\r\nMandrill is a [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) web application written using the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) framework. It supports one database engine: [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/). There are no plans to support other engines, but fear not, [mandrillctl](https://github.com/wollardj/mandrillctl) will install and secure MongoDB for you. If you already have MongoDB running on your server via homebrew, you should probably remove that installation first, or use an alternate server.\r\n\r\n![mandrill git-log](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2027935/2168353/05ff8e08-953a-11e3-9db0-c2b913db89e7.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation Prerequisites\r\n\r\n * Host operating systems that have been tested include OS X, OS X Server, Ubuntu Server, and CentOS, but any flavor of Linux or Unix should suffice.\r\n * **[NodeJS >= v0.10.22 with NPM](http://nodejs.org/download/)** _(both tools are in the 'Universal' link for the Mac OS X Installer .pkg)_.\r\n\r\n## Installing `mandrillctl`\r\nInstallation kicks off with the installation of the command line tool for Mandrill, `mandrillctl`. Since you're here, you've already got npm and node installed, so all you need to do is...\r\n\r\n\r\n\tsudo npm install -g mandrillctl\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `-g` means it's installing mandrillctl globally instead of within your home directory. It's also going to drop a symlink in your search path which you probably wouldn't be able to do without running it through `sudo`.\r\n\r\n### Installing Mandrill On OS X\r\n`mandrillctl` makes it pretty simple to install MongoDB + Mandrill and have your server running in no time. In general, there are four commands you'll want to run to make this happen:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t# Install mandrill\r\n\tsudo mandrillctl --install\r\n\r\n\t# Defaults to port 80.\r\n\t# If you specify a port that's in use by another process,\r\n\t# mandrillctl let you know.\r\n\tsudo mandrillctl --set-http-port 3001\r\n\r\n\t# Set your hostname (sub directories aren't supported)\r\n\tsudo mandrillctl --set-http-host http://mandrill.example.com\r\n\r\n\t# Don't forget to turn on the lights before you go\r\n\tsudo mandrillctl --start\r\n\r\nThat's it! Using the example values above, you should now be able to open your browser to http://mandrill.example.com:3001 and login!\r\n\r\n### Initial Login\r\nLike any good web app, the default username and password are `admin` and `admin`. _I hope it's obvious that you should change this password immediately._\r\n\r\n### Installing Mandrill on Linux\r\n\r\nSee the step through wiki guide for [Ubuntu](https://github.com/wollardj/Mandrill/wiki/Creating-Users-%26-Groups-%28Ubuntu%29) or [CentOS](https://github.com/wollardj/Mandrill/wiki/Creating-Users-%26-Groups-%28CentOS%29)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## More about `mandrillctl` on OS X Hosts\r\n\r\n_(Linux support is coming)_\r\n\r\n### Updating Mandrill\r\nMandrill has a built in command for updating to the current release\r\n\r\n\tsudo mandrillctl --update\r\n\r\n### Additional Mandrill commands\r\nYou can get a list of mandrillctl options by issuing:\r\n\r\n\tmandrillctl --help\r\n\r\nAs of version 0.7.1 the following options are available:\r\n\r\n    -h, --help                     output usage information\r\n    -i, --install                  Alias for --update\r\n    -u, --update                   Installs or updates Mandrill and its\r\n                                   requirements.\r\n                                   NOTE: If you need to use a proxy server, set \r\n                                   the http_proxy environment variable prior to\r\n                                   running this command.\r\n                                   `export http_proxy=http://proxy.server:port/`\r\n    -f, --force                    Use with -u or -i to bypass prompts\r\n    -s, --status                   Displays the status of the Mandrill and MongoDB\r\n                                   server processes.\r\n    --stop                         Halts the MongoDB and Mandrill servers\r\n    --start                        Starts the MongoDB and Mandrill servers\r\n    --restart                      Restarts the MongoDB and Mandrill servers\r\n    --no-logo                      Don't include the Mandrill logo and version in\r\n                                   the output\r\n    --get-http-port                Displays the port on which Mandrill will listen\r\n    --set-http-port <port>         Sets the port on which Mandrill will\r\n                                   listen\r\n    --get-http-host                Displays the host/fqdn for the Mandrill server.\r\n    --set-http-host <http://fqdn>  Sets the host/fqdn for the\r\n                                   Mandrill server\r\n    --uninstall                    Uninstalls Mandrill, MongoDB + databases.\r\n                                   mandrillctl will not uninstall itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions?\r\nAsk away: [https://groups.google.com/d/forum/mandrill-dev](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/mandrill-dev)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
